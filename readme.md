# Thumber Dynamic

This project is the simple scripted version of Thumber template that gets the images from inner folder dynamically.

You may reach the original version by:  [Colorlib Thumber](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/thumber/)

## Getting Started

- The `Thumber Dynamic` will show the images those are in the images folder.
- Images should be prefixed with "**img_**" and number between `1` to `99` after the prefix.
- Thumber dynamic supports up to 99 images. 
- Image number should be sequential, missing orders will stop the loop; *afterwards won't show up*.
